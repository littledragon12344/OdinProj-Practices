    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Boursin omelet is a quick, luxurious breakfast that brings creamy texture and rich flavor to the classic omelet. Finish with a sprinkle of chives for a fresh pop of color.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of water</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh chives</li>
        <li>1 ounce soft French cheese, such as Boursin&reg; cheese (any flavor), crumbled</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, water, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until yolks and whites are completely combined and eggs are light and frothy, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Pour eggs into skillet and stir rapidly for 20 to 30 seconds until eggs are just starting to set.</li>
        <li>Spread top of eggs in an even layer and let cook until just slightly underdone and shiny.</li>
        <li>(Optional) Move extra raw egg around to the edges of the skillet. Lower heat to medium-low to prevent browning.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cheese down the middle of the omelet, along with 2 teaspoons chives.</li>
        <li>Fold one side over the cheese in the middle, followed by the other side, so the omelet is folded in thirds.</li>
        <li>Remove to a plate and sprinkle with remaining chives.</li>
    </ol>
