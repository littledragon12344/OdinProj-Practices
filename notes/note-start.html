        <p>Before entering, Link read the warning at the entrance of the cave: <strong>Caution! Fire-breathing dragon ahead.</strong></p> 
        
        <!-- <em> tags indicate emphasis and change the meaning of our content. -->
        <p>Futher and futher Link went into the cave. With each step, it grew darker. This was a <em>very</em> deep cave indeed.</p> 
        
        <!-- <i> tags convey an alternate mood or voice from surrounding content. -->
        <p>As he traveled deeper into the cave, Link thought to himself, <i>I hope Princess Zelda is in here.</i></p>
        
        <!-- <b> tags draw attention to parts of our markup without providing any other semantics. -->
        <p>Link finally reached Princess Zelda, but was met by a fire-breathing dragon! Luckily, Link has <b>The Master Sword</b> and used it to defeat the dragon and escape the cave.</p>

    <!-- Specificity -->
    <!-- 
        1. ID (most specific)
        2. class
        3. type

        Only taken into account when an element has multiple, conflicting declarations targetting it, sort of like a tie breaker.
        When there is no declaration with a selector of higher specificity, a rule with a greater number of selectors of the same type will take precedence over another rule with fewer selectors of the same type.

        When comparing selectors, you may come across special symbols for the universal selector (*) as well as combinators (+, ~, >, and an empty space). These symbols do not add any specificity in and of themselves.

    <!-- Inheritance -->
    <!-- 
        refers to certain CSS properties that, when applied to an element, are inherited by that element’s descendants, even if we don’t explicitly write a rule for those descendants. Typography-based properties (color, font-size, font-family, etc.) are usually inherited, while most other properties aren’t.

        Whichever rule was the last defined is the winner.

        border      =>  add space (even if it’s only a pixel or two) between the margin and the padding
        margin      =>  increases the space between the borders of a box and the borders of adjacent boxes
