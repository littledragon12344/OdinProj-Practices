        <p>Before entering, Link read the warning at the entrance of the cave: <strong>Caution! Fire-breathing dragon ahead.</strong></p> 
        
        <!-- <em> tags indicate emphasis and change the meaning of our content. -->
        <p>Futher and futher Link went into the cave. With each step, it grew darker. This was a <em>very</em> deep cave indeed.</p> 
        
        <!-- <i> tags convey an alternate mood or voice from surrounding content. -->
        <p>As he traveled deeper into the cave, Link thought to himself, <i>I hope Princess Zelda is in here.</i></p>
        
        <!-- <b> tags draw attention to parts of our markup without providing any other semantics. -->
        <p>Link finally reached Princess Zelda, but was met by a fire-breathing dragon! Luckily, Link has <b>The Master Sword</b> and used it to defeat the dragon and escape the cave.</p>

    <!-- href specifies the destination link, target specifies where the linked resource will be opened.

     <!-- rel attribute is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document. 
      The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened.
      The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. The noreferrer value also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well.-->
